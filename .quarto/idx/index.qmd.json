I recently completed my MSc under the supervision of [Dr. Erin Bertrand](https://erinbertrand.wixsite.com/bertrandlab), which specialized in marine microbial ecophysiology. \n\nI’m currently an analyst and citizen developer for Statistics Canada’s Innovation SURGE team. As part of the SURGE team, I help internal clients to transition to open source tools and workflows for data science using R, Python, and Git.\n\nWhen I’m not writing up a script, you can often find me cycling, cooking, or teaching. I’m passionate about getting young people excited about science and providing access to information, tools, and skills that spark scientific creativity.\n\n**Interests:** Marine Ecology, Science Communication, Equity and Inclusivity, Climate Justice, Scientific Computing \n\n\n## Inquiries\nIf you have questions about my work or are interested in collaborating, feel free to [contact me](mailto:alburycatalina@dal.ca). I am always interested in discussing data science workshop offerings. \n\n## Mentorship\nI am open to acting as a mentor to youth navigating a career in science when I have the capacity. If you are part of a group which has historically been excluded from STEM and are seeking a mentor, please [reach out via email](mailto:alburycatalina@dal.ca) with a short introduction about yourself. \n\n:::\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"minty","title":"C.
