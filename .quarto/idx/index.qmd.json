I’m currently the data products steward for the Pacific Data Stewardship Unit (DSU) at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. As data products steward, I build data pipelines that ensure  access to important ecological datasets. \n\nI completed an MSc in Biology under the supervision of [Dr. Erin Bertrand](https://erinbertrand.wixsite.com/bertrandlab). At the Bertrand lab, my research area was marine microbial ecophysiology (the study of how organisms react to environmental change). I used meta-omic analyses and bioinformatic pipelines to understand how trace nurtient and temperature dynamics impact microbial function. \n\n\n\nI mantain [the Employment Equity](https://employment-equity.github.io/) site, which hosts analyses and visualizations for disproportionalities in pay based on race across the Canadian Public Service from data [publicly available here](https://www.canada.ca/en/treasury-board-secretariat/services/innovation/human-resources-statistics/diversity-inclusion-statistics.html) through Canada's Treasury Board.  \n\nWhen I’m not writing up a script, you can often find me cycling, cooking, or teaching. I’m passionate about getting young people excited about science and providing access to information, tools, and skills that spark scientific creativity.\n\n**Interests:** Marine Ecology, Science Communication, Equity and Inclusivity, Climate Justice, Scientific Computing \n\n\n## Inquiries\nIf you have questions about my work or are interested in collaborating, feel free to [contact me](mailto:alburycatalina@dal.ca). I am always interested in discussing data science consulting or workshop offerings. \n\n## Mentorship\nI am open to acting as a mentor to youth navigating a career in science when I have the capacity. If you are part of a group which has historically been excluded from STEM and are seeking a mentor, please [reach out via email](mailto:alburycatalina@dal.ca) with a short introduction about yourself. \n\n:::\n\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"include-after-body":["html/analytics.html"],"include-in-header":["html/coffee.html"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","editor":"visual","theme":"minty","title":"Albury C., MSc","image":"images/profile.jpg","about":{"template":"trestles","links":[{"text":"LinkedIn","icon":"linkedin","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alburycatalina"},{"text":"GitHub","icon":"github","url":"https://github.com/alburycatalina"},{"text":"ORCID","icon":"person-circle","url":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1061-9213"},{"text":"ResearchGate","icon":"journal","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Catalina-Albury"},{"text":"Email","icon":"envelope","url":"mailto:alburycatalina@dal.ca"}]},"comments":false},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
